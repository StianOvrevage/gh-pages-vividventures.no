My name is Stian Øvrevåge. I'm a creative problem solver and cannot help but to look at the world and wanting to hang on to it.

I got my first SLR camera in the 90'ies and have pressed the shutter of various a few hundred thousand times by now.

Very recently I'm also playing around with moving images, aka video.

When I'm not playing with cameras I do other stuff. Have a look at [stian.omg.lol](https://stian.omg.lol) for more of that :D
